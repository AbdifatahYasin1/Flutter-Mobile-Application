## Installing Flutter and Android Studio

### Git Installation

1. Check if Git is installed on your computer by running `git` in the command prompt.
2. Download and install Git for Windows: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Flutter Installation

1. Go to the Flutter website and download the Flutter SDK: [https://flutter-ko.dev/get-started/install](https://flutter-ko.dev/get-started/install)
2. Select the operating system you are installing Flutter on.
3. To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:
   - Operating Systems: Windows 10 or later (64-bit), x86-64 based.
   - Disk Space: 1.64 GB (does not include disk space for IDE/tools).
   - Tools: Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment:
     - Windows PowerShell 5.0 or newer (pre-installed with Windows 10)
     - Git for Windows 2.x, with the "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" option.
4. Download the Flutter zip file: `Flutter_windows_3.22.1-stable.zip`.
5. Extract the zip file to `C:\src`.
6. Run `flutter doctor` in the command prompt. If Flutter is not recognized, you need to correct the path.
7. To correct the path, go to `C:\src\flutter\bin`, search for "environment" in the Windows search bar, click "Environment Variables", and add the Flutter bin folder to the "Path" user variable.
8. Run `flutter doctor` again to check if Flutter is installed correctly.

### Android Studio Installation

1. Download and install Android Studio: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Download the emulator from Android Studio.
3. Open Android Studio.
4. Go to the Device Manager, click "Create New Virtual Device", choose a phone category (e.g., Pixel XL), select Android R, and make sure to select "Hardware" for the Graphics option (to maintain emulator speed).

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Installation

1. Download and install VS Code.
2. Install the Flutter and Dart extensions.

### Creating your first Flutter app

1. In VS Code, go to the Command Palette (View > Command Palette) and choose "New Project".
